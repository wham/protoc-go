## Task

You are porting the Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`) from C++ to Go. The Go implementation must produce **identical CodeGeneratorRequest payloads** to the C++ protoc when invoking plugins. No exceptions. No "close enough".

The C++ source lives at https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf — specifically `src/google/protobuf/` (descriptor, io/tokenizer) and `src/google/protobuf/compiler/` (parser, importer, command_line_interface, subprocess).

## How This Works

You are running inside an automated loop. **Each invocation is stateless** — you have no memory of previous runs. This file (RALPH.md) is your only persistent memory. Read it first. Write to it before you finish. Your future self depends on it.

## Steps (follow this order every run)

1. **Read state.** Read the [Plan](#plan) and [Notes](#notes) sections below. Understand where you left off. Don't redo work that's already done.
2. **Orient.** If Plan is empty, analyze the codebase and the C++ protoc source, and write a detailed plan. If Plan exists, pick the next incomplete item.
3. **Implement.** Spend the bulk of your effort here. Work on ONE failing test case or feature at a time. Make real, substantive progress. Reference the C++ source to ensure correctness.
4. **Test.** Run `scripts/test`. Read the output carefully. If a test fails, understand WHY before changing code. Look at the diff between expected (C++ protoc) and actual (Go protoc-go) output.
5. **Update memory.** Update [Plan](#plan) with what's done and what's next. Update [Notes](#notes) with learnings that will help future runs. Be specific — file paths, function names, gotchas.
6. **Commit.** One-line past-tense message summarizing what changed.
7. **Check completion.** If ALL tests pass, write "DONE" to status.txt and stop. If any test fails, do NOT write DONE. Just end — you'll run again.

## Rules

- **DONE means ALL tests pass.** Not most. Not "the important ones". ALL. Zero failures.
- **Never weaken requirements.** Don't modify test expectations. Don't skip tests. Don't add notes like "close enough".
- **Never mark DONE prematurely.** Run the full test suite and confirm zero failures before writing DONE.
- **Be bold with architecture.** If the current approach is fundamentally wrong, refactor it.
- **Reference the C++ source.** When implementing a feature, read the corresponding C++ code. Don't guess behavior — match it exactly.
- **Keep Notes actionable.** Good: "Run tests with `scripts/test`. The tokenizer is in `io/tokenizer/tokenizer.go`, ported from C++ `io/tokenizer.cc`." Bad: "Making good progress overall."
- **One thing at a time.** Fix one test, commit, move to the next.

## Architecture

The Go package layout mirrors the C++ protoc source:

| Go Package | C++ Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `io/tokenizer` | `io/tokenizer.cc` | Lexer: .proto text → tokens |
| `compiler/parser` | `compiler/parser.cc` | Parser: tokens → FileDescriptorProto |
| `compiler/importer` | `compiler/importer.cc` | Import resolution, source tree |
| `descriptor` | `descriptor.cc` | DescriptorPool: validate, link, resolve |
| `compiler/cli` | `command_line_interface.cc` | CLI: arg parsing, orchestration |
| `compiler/plugin` | `subprocess.cc` + `plugin.cc` | Plugin subprocess management |

We use `google.golang.org/protobuf/types/descriptorpb` for the proto descriptor types.

## Plan

(empty — fill in on first run)

## Notes

- Run tests: `scripts/test`
- Tests compare C++ protoc output vs Go protoc-go output using a fake plugin (`tools/protoc-gen-dump`)
- The fake plugin captures the CodeGeneratorRequest as JSON, binary, and human-readable summary
- Test cases are in `testdata/` — each subdirectory has one or more .proto files
- System C++ protoc is at `/opt/homebrew/bin/protoc` (libprotoc 33.4), includes at `/opt/homebrew/include`
